## KPIs

Key performance indicators are mesures of underlying quantity of work and
effort going into producing a unit of revenue or profit. In order to improve revenue and profit, it is important to measure 
and improve the underlying performance indicators. For example, if a construction company wants to increase its revenue, 
it may need to improve its project completion rate, workforce productivity, or customer satisfaction rate. By measuring 
these performance indicators, the company can identify areas for improvement and take actions to increase revenue.

The company's management structure depend upon the size and complexity of its projects, with typical positions such as CEO, COO, CFO, project managers, site supervisors, and administrative staff, each having their distinc set of responsibilities.

The number of projects completed per year will depend on the size and complexity of the projects, as well as the company's capacity and resources. According to industry standards, a mid-sized construction company may complete anywhere from 10 to 50 projects per year, depending on the size and complexity of the projects.

The cost structure will depend on the company's business model, the types of construction projects it undertakes, and the geographic location of its operations. The cost of goods sold (COGS) for a can range from 60 to 80 percent of revenue. Assuming a COGS ratio of 70 percent, the company's total cost structure could be between 280 and 320 million euros per year.

Similarly company's workforce with revenue of 400m â‚¬ can range from 500 to 2,000 or more and the inventory turnover ratio can range from 4 to 8 times per year. Assuming an inventory turnover ratio of 6, the company could have an inventory size of between 66 and 133 million euros.


## radar display for key Quality dimensions

Here are some possible absolute targets and  for each of the TQM metrics you listed:
Efficiency:
Average project duration: 11 months (targeting a 1 month reduction) | Weight: 30%
Percentage of projects completed on time: 90% (targeting a 10% improvement) | Weight: 30%
Average project cost compared to budget: 10% under budget (targeting a 5% improvement) | Weight: 30%

Sustainability:
Carbon footprint of the company's operations: 2,000 metric tons CO2e (targeting a 20% reduction) | Weight: 30%
Percentage of waste materials recycled or reused: 75% (targeting a 15% improvement) | Weight: 30%
Number of LEED-certified projects completed: 15 (targeting a 5-project increase) |Weight: 30%

Customer satisfaction:
Customer satisfaction ratings from surveys: 95% (targeting a 5% improvement) | Weight: 30%
Percentage of repeat business from customers: 80% (targeting a 10% improvement) | Weight: 30%
Percentage of projects completed without customer complaints or disputes: 98% (targeting a 3% improvement) | Weight: 30%

Competitiveness:
Percentage of bids won: 50% (targeting a 10% improvement) | Weight: 30%
Revenue growth compared to industry average: 7% (targeting a 2% improvement) | Weight: 30%
Market share compared to competitors: 20% (targeting a 5% improvement) | Weight: 30%

## Traffic light system to display status of critical metrics
Example of defect would be not meeting quality standards or any of following:
Number of project delays or cancellations > 5%
Number of cost overruns on projects is > 5%

Example of trends would be:
Revenue growth over time
Cost trends (e.g., materials, labor, overhead)
Project completion rates over time
Customer satisfaction trends over time
Sustainability performance trends over time (e.g., energy usage, carbon footprint, waste management)


### Good points:

Including the Total Quality Health radar is a great way to provide a comprehensive overview of the company's performance in terms of efficiency, sustainability, customer satisfaction, and competitiveness.
Displaying the cost structure and revenue over time can give the CEO insight into how the company's financials are trending.
The traffic light display is a useful way to quickly convey the status of key ongoing processes and potential risks.
### Areas for improvement:

While the Total Quality Health radar is a good addition, it may be helpful to include more specific metrics within each category to provide more actionable insights.
Consider including other key performance indicators (KPIs) beyond cost structure and revenue, such as profitability or employee satisfaction, depending on the CEO's priorities.
The traffic light display can be improved by providing more context around why certain processes are flagged as red or yellow, and what actions are being taken to address them.
### Potential ways to spice it up:

Consider incorporating interactive elements, such as hover-over tooltips or drill-down capabilities, to allow the CEO to explore the data in more detail.
Try experimenting with different chart types or visualizations to make the data more engaging, such as using a stacked bar chart for the cost structure over time.
Consider adding in external data sources, such as industry benchmarks or macroeconomic indicators, to provide additional context around the company's performance.
